<div class="div2"> 
<h3><a name="intro-background"></a>1.1 Background</h3> 
<p>Forms are an important part of the Web, and they continue to be the
      primary means of interactivity used by many Web sites. Web applications and
      eCommerce solutions have sparked the demand for better Web forms with richer
      interactions. XForms are the response to this demand--extended analysis,
      followed by the creation of a new platform-independent markup language for
      online interaction between an <a title="" href="#">XForms Processor</a> and
      a remote entity. XForms are the successor to XHTML forms, and benefit from the
      lessons learned in the years of HTML forms implementation experience.</p>
    <p>Further background information on XForms can be found at 
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/">http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="intro-reading"></a>1.2 Reading the Specification</h3>
    <p>This specification has been written with various types of readers in
      mind--in particular XForms authors and XForms implementors. We hope the
      specification will provide authors with the tools they need to write efficient,
      attractive, and accessible documents, without overexposing them to the XForms
      implementation details. Implementors, however, should find all they need to
      build conforming XForms Processors. The specification begins with a general
      presentation of XForms and becomes more and more technical and specific towards
      the end. For quick access to information, a general table of contents, specific
      tables of contents at the beginning of each section, and an index provide easy
      navigation, in both the electronic and printed versions.</p>
    <p>The specification has been written with two modes of presentation in
      mind: electronic and printed. In case of a discrepancy, the electronic version
      is considered the authoritative version of the document.</p>

<p>Forms are an important part of the Web, and they continue to be the
      primary means of interactivity used by many Web sites. Web applications and
      eCommerce solutions have sparked the demand for better Web forms with richer
      interactions. XForms are the response to this demand--extended analysis,
      followed by the creation of a new platform-independent markup language for
      online interaction between an <a title="" href="#">XForms Processor</a> and
      a remote entity. XForms are the successor to XHTML forms, and benefit from the
      lessons learned in the years of HTML forms implementation experience.</p>

    <p>This specification has been written with various types of readers in

      attractive, and accessible documents, without overexposing them to the XForms
      implementation details. Implementors, however, should find all they need to
      build conforming XForms Processors. The specification begins with a general
      presentation of XForms and becomes more and more technical and specific towards
      the end. For quick access to information, a general table of contents, specific
      tables of contents at the beginning of each section, and an index provide easy
      navigation, in both the electronic and printed versions.</p>
    <p>The specification has been written with two modes of presentation in
      mind: electronic and printed. In case of a discrepancy, the electronic version
      is considered the authoritative version of the document.</p>

<p>Forms are an important part of the Web, and they continue to be the
      primary means of interactivity used by many Web sites. Web applications and
      eCommerce solutions have sparked the demand for better Web forms with richer
      interactions. XForms are the response to this demand--extended analysis,
      followed by the creation of a new platform-independent markup language for
      online interaction between an <a title="" href="#">XForms Processor</a> and
      a remote entity. XForms are the successor to XHTML forms, and benefit from the

      build conforming XForms Processors. The specification begins with a general
      presentation of XForms and becomes more and more technical and specific towards
      the end. For quick access to information, a general table of contents, specific
      tables of contents at the beginning of each section, and an index provide easy
      navigation, in both the electronic and printed versions.</p>
    <p>The specification has been written with two modes of presentation in

<h3><a name="intro-background"></a>1.49 Background</h3> 
<p>Forms are an important part of the Web, and they continue to be the
      primary means of interactivity used by many Web sites. Web applications and
      eCommerce solutions have sparked the demand for better Web forms with richer
      interactions. XForms are the response to this demand--extended analysis,
      followed by the creation of a new platform-independent markup language for
      online interaction between an <a title="" href="#">XForms Processor</a> and
      a remote entity. XForms are the successor to XHTML forms, and benefit from the
      lessons learned in the years of HTML forms implementation experience.</p>

      implementation details. Implementors, however, should find all they need to
      build conforming XForms Processors. The specification begins with a general
      presentation of XForms and becomes more and more technical and specific towards
      the end. For quick access to information, a general table of contents, specific
      tables of contents at the beginning of each section, and an index provide easy
      navigation, in both the electronic and printed versions.</p>
    <p>The specification has been written with two modes of presentation in

<p>Forms are an important part of the Web, and they continue to be the
      primary means of interactivity used by many Web sites. Web applications and
      eCommerce solutions have sparked the demand for better Web forms with richer
      interactions. XForms are the response to this demand--extended analysis,
      followed by the creation of a new platform-independent markup language for
      online interaction between an <a title="" href="#">XForms Processor</a> and

<p>Forms are an important part of the Web, and they continue to be the
      primary means of interactivity used by many Web sites. Web applications and
      eCommerce solutions have sparked the demand for better Web forms with richer
      interactions. XForms are the response to this demand--extended analysis,
      followed by the creation of a new platform-independent markup language for
      online interaction between an <a title="" href="#">XForms Processor</a> and

      the end. For quick access to information, a general table of contents, specific
      tables of contents at the beginning of each section, and an index provide easy
      navigation, in both the electronic and printed versions.</p>
    <p>The specification has been written with two modes of presentation in

<h3><a name="intro-background"></a>1.97 Background</h3> 
<p>Forms are an important part of the Web, and they continue to be the
      primary means of interactivity used by many Web sites. Web applications and
      eCommerce solutions have sparked the demand for better Web forms with richer
      interactions. XForms are the response to this demand--extended analysis,
      followed by the creation of a new platform-independent markup language for
      online interaction between an <a title="" href="#">XForms Processor</a> and
      a remote entity. XForms are the successor to XHTML forms, and benefit from the
      lessons learned in the years of HTML forms implementation experience.</p>

      attractive, and accessible documents, without overexposing them to the XForms
      implementation details. Implementors, however, should find all they need to
      build conforming XForms Processors. The specification begins with a general
      presentation of XForms and becomes more and more technical and specific towards
      the end. For quick access to information, a general table of contents, specific
      tables of contents at the beginning of each section, and an index provide easy
      navigation, in both the electronic and printed versions.</p>
    <p>The specification has been written with two modes of presentation in
      mind: electronic and printed. In case of a discrepancy, the electronic version
      is considered the authoritative version of the document.</p>

<h3><a name="intro-reading"></a>1.126 Reading the Specification</h3>
    <p>This specification has been written with various types of readers in
      mind--in particular XForms authors and XForms implementors. We hope the
      specification will provide authors with the tools they need to write efficient,
      attractive, and accessible documents, without overexposing them to the XForms
      implementation details. Implementors, however, should find all they need to
      build conforming XForms Processors. The specification begins with a general
      presentation of XForms and becomes more and more technical and specific towards
      the end. For quick access to information, a general table of contents, specific
      tables of contents at the beginning of each section, and an index provide easy
      navigation, in both the electronic and printed versions.</p>
    <p>The specification has been written with two modes of presentation in

      attractive, and accessible documents, without overexposing them to the XForms
      implementation details. Implementors, however, should find all they need to
      build conforming XForms Processors. The specification begins with a general
      presentation of XForms and becomes more and more technical and specific towards
      the end. For quick access to information, a general table of contents, specific
      tables of contents at the beginning of each section, and an index provide easy
      navigation, in both the electronic and printed versions.</p>
    <p>The specification has been written with two modes of presentation in
